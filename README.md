# PDF-labeler
a simple application that labels a single pdf file with multiple labels(e.g. names, group names, etc.) and produces a single labeled pdf file. For instance, if there are three names to be labeled on one two-paged pdf file, this application makes a six-paged pdf file which each two pages labeled with each name.
